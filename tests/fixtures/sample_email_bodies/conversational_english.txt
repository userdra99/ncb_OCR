Hi there,

I'm sending you my medical bill from last week when I visited Dr. Tan's clinic in Bangsar. My member number is M67890 and my name is Sarah Lee.

I went there on the 18th of December for a really bad flu. The doctor gave me antibiotics and some other meds. The total came to RM 350.75. Receipt number is DT-2024-1234.

The clinic is called Dr. Tan Medical Centre and it's located at 45 Jalan Telawi 3, Bangsar.

I've attached the receipt - hope everything is clear! Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks so much!
Sarah
